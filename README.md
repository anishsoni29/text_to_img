# Text to Image

[![Text to Image](https://img.shields.io/badge/Text%20to%20Image-Stable%20Diffusion-blue)](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0)

## Overview

This project implements text-to-image generation using Stable Diffusion, a state-of-the-art technique for generating high-quality images from textual descriptions. The Stable Diffusion model allows for realistic and diverse image generation based on input text prompts.

## Features

- Generate high-quality images from textual descriptions.
- Fine-tune the model for specific datasets or use pre-trained models.
- Support for various image resolutions and styles.
- Easy-to-use interface for generating images from text.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/text_to_img.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd text_to_img
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download pre-trained models (if available) or prepare your dataset.

4. Run the text-to-image generation script:

   ```bash
   python generate_images.py --text "Your text prompt here"
   ```

## Usage

- Modify the `generate_images.py` script to customize image generation settings.
- Experiment with different text prompts to generate a variety of images.
- Integrate the text-to-image generation functionality into your applications or workflows.
